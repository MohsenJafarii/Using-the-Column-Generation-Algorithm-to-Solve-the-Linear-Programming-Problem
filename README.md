This research explores the application of the column generation algorithm in optimizing transportation networks and addressing the cutting stock problem. Supply and demand dynamics form the backbone of transportation network systems and are crucial for efficient travel flow. Because of its significance, managing supply and demand in complex transportation networks poses challenges, necessitating innovative optimization solutions. The column generation algorithm, an optimization technique used to solve large-scale linear programming problems and renowned for its efficiency in solving large-size optimization problems, is investigated within the context of transportation network optimization and the cutting stock problem. While the algorithm proves ineffective for transportation networks due to inherent complexities, it excels at minimizing waste and optimizing stock cutting for the cutting stock problem. The column generation algorithm solved the cutting stock problem in a single iteration, while the conventional simplex method solved it in four iterations, indicating the high computational power of the column generation algorithm and its rapid rate of reaching the optimal solution. Through comprehensive problem formulations, algorithmic implementations, and solution validations, this research sheds light on the algorithm's versatility, limitations, and practical implications in diverse optimization domains.
